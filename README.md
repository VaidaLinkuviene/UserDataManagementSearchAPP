# UserDataManagementSearchAPP

Generated 100 users using mockaroo.com and added to data.js file.
These useres were added to the "All users" table and pagination was implemented.
User can be find by name and last name. 
I can click on user and popup with more information appears. I can close it or add it to the "Selected users" list.
When user is added to the "Selected users" list, I cannot add it again - button is dissabled.
I can delete user from "Selected users" list.
When user is deleted, "Add to the list" button becomes enabled and user can be added to the list again.
